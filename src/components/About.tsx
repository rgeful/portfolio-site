                My journey in programming started a few years ago, and since then, I&apos;ve been continuously learning and improving my skills in various technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Node.js. I&apos;m always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on exciting projects.

                When I&apos;m not coding, I like to explore new tech trends, contribute to open-source projects, and connect with other developers in the community.
